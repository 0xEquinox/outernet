## Workshop name

### Plan
> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)
> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)

#### Outline
1. Get people to open sprig.hackclub.com on their computers
2. Have them make a new project 
3. Show them some demo code, and helper functions (walk them through everything)
<br> .. and so forth

**How much time do you think it'll take?**: 30 mins

### Do you think you might need anything?
> We are not able to offer a projecter for workshops, but if you think you might need anything else like hardware boards, or other supplies like paint that you would need us to purchase or have on hand?

[Add everything you might need here]


### People involved
> List all the people who are running this workshop if it's more than 1!
