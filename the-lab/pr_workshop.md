## Workshop name

### Plan
> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)
> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)

#### Outline
1. Get people to open sprig.hackclub.com on their computers
2. Have them make a new project 
3. Show them some demo code, and helper functions (walk them through everything)
<br> .. and so forth

**How much time do you think it'll take?**: 30 mins

### Do you think you might need anything?
> Will you need a projecter, or do you think you'll be okay without one? (We only have a limited # of projecters), Do you need hardware boards, or other supplies like paint that you would need us to purchase or have on hand?

Filler text is something right? Anyhow, I'm not quite sure what to put here. So I'm just writing random thoughts and words that come into my mind. I guess you could say
that it's somewhat logical, and has an order. I'm lazy, so now I'm just going to say the word filler again and again, filler, filler, filler, filler, filler, filler, filler

(This section can also be in jot notes if you'd like!)
