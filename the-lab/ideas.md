## Ideas?
- Use the concept of a Unconfrence as a guide -- more partipcant driven (How can we do that in the best way?)
- Workshops should be fun and engagaing. People should leave with a mini-project of their own
- They should be techinal and non-techinal
- Workshop slots open to anyone to signup during event?
- How can we foster a space for people to have fun? -> workshops should not feel like lectures; workshops should feel like they're something new or adding on
- Lighting Talks! 2-5 minute presentions with no or as little slides as possible on any topic
- what about nano talks? 2-3 minute presentions?
- Encourage people to not use slides? Have a whiteboard that rolls
- AV setup -> just a projecter, whiteboard and some other stuff. Do we need a micrphone?
- Tents vs Cabins, We're thinking right now
- Have people sumbit their proposals in a github pr and markdown file
- Have people express interest for running stuff here
- Have all workshop stuff or most on github i.e schedule (at outernet) where people can signup, approved or shortlisted workshops can go
- [WIP]
